This project aims to make the communication between different companies and their customers as efficient, satisfying and helpful for both parties as possible. Customer service is one of the most important aspects of any business that aims to provide an exceptional service, the important part is to keep the customers loyal to the service you provide, especially when there are other competitors. This in turn increases the amount of money each customer spends with your business and generate positive word-of-mouth about your business which attracts other possible customers. Due to the impact that customer service has on any business, a considerable amount of money is invested to keep the customers satisfaction, as an alternative to traditional customer service, we aim to provide a more convenient, cost efficient and automatic customer service based on Natural Language Processing. Natural language processing (NLP) is a branch of artificial intelligence that helps computers understand, interpret and manipulate human language, it combines Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computational linguistics so that computers and humans can talk seamlessly, it has a great potential to boost the customer service experience, it has the ability to analyze text, extract its context and reply to different inquiries accordingly. It can exploit the large amount of textual data thatâ€™s generated every day and help deduce valuable information to identify the root cause of customer satisfaction and implement improvements
